## 🎯 **How to Play Freecell**

### 1. **Game Goal** 🏆

The goal of **FreeCell** is to move all the cards to the foundation piles, in **ascending order** (from Ace to King) and by **suit** (hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs). There are 4 foundation piles, one for each suit.

### 2. **Game Layout** 🃏

- The game starts with **52 cards** placed in **8 columns**.
- Each column may have one or more cards, with some cards face up and others face down.
- Use the **4 Free Cells** 🆓 to temporarily store cards while organizing the columns.

### 3. **Card Movement** 🔄

- You can move cards between columns if the card being moved is **one rank lower** and of the **opposite color** of the target card.
- You can also move cards to **Free Cells** to temporarily store them or place them in the foundation piles in ascending order.

### 4. **Winning the Game** 🏅

You win the game when all the cards are correctly placed in the **foundation piles** in ascending order (Ace to King) and sorted by suit.
